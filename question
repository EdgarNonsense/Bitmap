What happens if the player enters a blank string for the message?
* Either the process ends, or it gives a blank map
Does it matter what the nonspace characters are in the bitmap variableâ€™s string?
*  It doesn't matter
What does the i variable created on line 45 represent?
* it represents every character in the input
What bug happens if you delete or comment out print() on line 52?
* removes a new line after putting an input, making the bitmap full spread out instead of how it normally is.
